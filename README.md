# This is a dashboard of energy generation in Guatemala

Here you will find the code to run the file in a 
web app server. The python file of the dashboard is 
present and the csv file that is already processed
in this repository.

This will be a dashboard that show my skills to 
create an interactive dashboard with the use of Plotly.

You will find two tabs in this dashboard
* The first tab will show the energy generation by 
  source in Guatemala (A single choice dropdown)
* The second tab will show the energy generation and 
  the ENOS index in Guatemala (A single choice dropdown)

All the data is process from these locations, which are 
free to the public:
* [**AMM, Administrator de Mercado Mayorista**](https://reportesbi.amm.org.gt)
* [**NOAA, climate for Monthly Ni√±o-3.4 index**](https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/detrend.nino34.ascii.txt)
